## VegMRFP:3D Reconstruction of Vegetation based on Mixed Radiance Field Primitives

Recently, 3D reconstruction based on radiance fields can present realistic 3D models at any angle and distance, providing high-quality mesh data for the construction of virtual scenes.The fractal structures such as self occlusion and multi branching of vegetation, as well as the thin leaves, hinder their development in realistic 3D representation and surface reconstruction. How to achieve more realistic 3D representation and surface reconstruction of vegetation through radiance field technology with less storage consumption is a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we propose VegeMRFP, a framework for vegetation radiance field representation and surface reconstruction using mixed radiance primitives. Our method utilizes 2D Gaussian primitives for vegetation branches representation and Billboard primitives for crowns modeling, combined with two novel storage optimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing radiance field approaches across three key metrics: superior rendering fidelity, higher-quality surface reconstruction, and substantially reduced storage consumption.
